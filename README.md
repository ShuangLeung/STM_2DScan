# STM_2DScan
STM-2DScan.py is a postprocessing script for VASP code to generate STM images  based on DFT-calculations. It firstly imports volumetric data from a file with  CHGCAR/PARCHG format and then interpolates the data onto specified two-dimensional (2D) slice in an  arbitrary xy-plane, which will be saved as a '.png' format file.
